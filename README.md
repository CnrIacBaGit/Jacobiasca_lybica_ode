Jacobiasca_lybica_ode is a MATLAB routine (version R2024b) that produces time distribution of eggs, nymphs and adults population.

The repository contains:

The data file "Arancio_dati_2000_2025.mat" for temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed

Scripts for generating the time distribution of eggs, nymphs and adults for Jacobiasca lybica population 

Scripts for generating plots of the sensitivity analysis with respect to adult immigration (Aintro) and environmental parameters (temperature, solar radiation, humidity and wind)

The routine has been implemented and developed by Angela Monti and Fasma Diele. It can be used under the conditions of CC-BY-NC 2.0

A full description of the model is available in: Deborah Lacitignola, Angela Monti, Emanuele Gosamo, Giovanni Attolico, Massimiliano Nitti,
